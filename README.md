&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collection of notebooks was put together for the 2021 TAP Institute's summer courses. They are meant to function as a quick introduction to machine learning. It will not sereve as a complete overview, rather a quick way to get a genereal understanding about what machine learning is and how it works. In notebooks 2 and 3, we will solve two different problems with machine learning--topic modeling and text classification.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notebook 1 will be more text-centric. It will focus on the key concepts and terms of machine learning that are essential in order to begin engaging in machine learning with Python. This will lay the groundwork necessary for the next two notebooks which will be focused on two Python libraries for engaging in ML, Gensim (Topic Modeling) and spaCy (text classification).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notebook 2 (Topic Modeling) will leverage an existing cultivated dataset 20-Newsgroup. While this dataset is not relevant to the humanities particularly, it provides a good toy example for how to load, clean, and work with an existing dataset. This is an essential skill, despite, as we shall discuss in Notebook 3 (Text Classification), the fact that humanists do not currently have access to a large number of well-cultivated datasets for research purposes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notebook 3 (Text Classification) will introduce readers to a common problem in the digital humanities: cultivating a good dataset to train a machine learning model. In this notebook, we will create a binary classification model that can determine if a Holocaust document deals with the concept of "hunger". We will cultivate a dataset using a few rules that will require manual validation. In this notebook, I will also introduce the reader to some concepts and terms not covered in this notebook, particularly types of classifications, prediction, and generalization.
