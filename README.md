These notebooks were put together for the 2021 TAP Institute's summer courses. Notebook 1 is meant to function as a quick introduction to machine learning. It will not sereve as a complete overview, rather a quick way to get a genereal understanding about what machine learning is and how it works. In notebooks 2 and 3, we will solve two different problems with machine learning--text classification and topic modeling. Notebook 1 will be more text-centric, while the next two will be focused on two Python libraries for engaging in ML, Gensim (Topic Modeling) and spaCy (text classification).
