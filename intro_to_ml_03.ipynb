    "In the last notebook, we engaged in a form of unsupervised learning. We allowed a system to take unstructured data and assign 20 categories to it. In this notebook, we will explore a different method of machine learning known as supervised learning. As noted in notebook 1, supervised learning is when we know the structure of our data. We have labels that correspond to that data and we leverage that knowledge to train a computer system to assign the same labels to similar unknown data. In NLP, text classification is a form of supervised learning.\n",

    "Classification tasks fall into roughly three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) binary classification<br>\n",
    "2) multiclass classification<br>\n",
    "3) multilabel classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences will not be explored in great detail here as we will be dealing primarily with binary text classification. You should, however, be familiar with these three categories as you will choose different approaches to solve different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Binary classification</b> is when a model has the ability to choose between two labels, a 0 and a 1. These numbers stand for a specific label. If we were to create a positive/negative review classifier (a common introducutory ML task), then 0 could be negative and 1 could be positive. After training, the model will see the entire world as either being positive or negative and when it encounters a new text, it will assign a float, or floating number (decimal) to that text. This is known as a <b>prediction</b>. The closer this prediction is to 0 or 1 indicates the degree to which the text at hand is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Multiclass classification</b> is when a model is designend to handle multiple potential labels. If we are trying to determine if a piece of text is a letter, movie review, or tax form, wew will have three potential labels (letter, movie_review, tax_form). The model will make a prediction based on its experiences during training to determine which of the texts it falls under. In multiclass classification, there can be only one label.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Multilabel classification</b> is like multiclass classification, except a text can have multiple labels. This is useful if you expect there to be multiple potential labels for texts in your corpus. Imagien if you have a text that is a letter in nature, but deals partially about a movie that the writer saw a few days earlier. A prediction of letter would be accurate as would movie_review, but a multiclass classification model cannot make these nuances known. A multilabel classification model can. Its output will look somewhat similar to a binary classification model for each potential label, so it may be (letter: 0.5030030, movie_review: 0.4020039, tax_form: 0.00002). This output captures the degree to which the text fits the form of a letter, but deals with the subject of a movie."

There is no collection of labeled data for 13th century French literature (at least I don't think there is). For this reason, this notebook will spend the majority of the time collating a dataset from scratch for text classification."
